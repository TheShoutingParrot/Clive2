# Oracle
Oracle is a siri/alexa/google-assistant like chatbot.
To read the instructions to download/use Oracle and more
read the wiki.


**PS:**

I made this when I didn't really know how to program or how to publish programs. The code
is messy and bad, it's almost impossible to read the code, but I still learned alot while doing this.

I don't care what you do with this program, so I put it under the unlicense.
